PROJECT PROPOSAL: 
I researched, designed and created homology directed repair plasmids at one of my previous jobs. After inserting 3' Arm and 5' Arm sequences into the plasmids (individually), we would conduct sequence analyses using a DNA sequencer. The output we were given was the visual alignment and the score of both the query (engineered) and the subject (genomic) sequence for whichever Arm we were sequencing (almost always <1000bp). I had to go in and manually analyze each sequence alignment (multiple for each clone), manually adjust scores when needed to account for sequencing machine error, and then input the analysis results into a book. I would have saved hours of work if I had had this bioinformatics tool to help me.


This project tool would go by 'HDR FixAlign' (work in progress)


User Input would include:
Two text boxes for both the Subject and Query Sequence
Scoring parameters (match score, gap penalty, etc).
If it is 5 Arm, 3 Arm, entire HDR template
Check box (either/or) for normal (5' -> 3') or reverse clone (3' -> 5')


Analysis (on the server):
Use pairwise2 within python cgi script to perform a pairwise alignment on the two given sequences
Output for User would include:
Alignment score
Sequence lengths
Visual alignment of the subject and query (labelled)                                 CSS
Misalignments in basepairs highlighted in red (this is going to be so cool)                CSS
Frameshift (Y/N)
Total misalignments
Table w/ misalignments
5 Arm vs 3 Arm region analysis (if more misalignments occur in the 3 Arm vs the 5 Arm region; ex. 10 mismatches in 3 Arm vs 2 in 5 Arm)
If 5Arm, pass >= 95% ; if 3Arm, pass >= 98%
**User approves specific mismatches (checkbox at misalignment in visual alignment); recalculates after submitting updates


Export Data to MYSQL database:
For each sequence alignment-
Sequences (Subject and Query)
Scoring parameters used (input)
Alignment score
User adjusted alignment score (2nd input)
Pass vs. no Pass
